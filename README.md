# Corlan-Documentation-and-IDE
This is where I will upload the files for the IDE for my programming language, Corlan (similar to C in ways, name inspired by Fortran)

To use the language, I'd recomend you use the "Corlan IDE.html" by downloading and running it. It has all the tools you'll need to use the language.
Keep reading to learn about the language and how to use it, and go to the very bottom to see some things you should NOT do if you want it to work properly.
I also have the DLSC1R Computer VM as an HTML file so you can run the programs you find/make.


--- About Corlan ---
Corlan is a programming language similar to C, though with a bit of the personality of Assembly.
The target hardware uses a shift register to move everything around the computer, and ALU to do math and logic with 2 inputs and one output, and is very RAM-based.

--- How to Use the IDE ---
The IDE has a lot of useful features, like saving/loading projects, adding custom commands (in case the built in ones don't get the job done), using "macros" as function-like things from languages like C, Python, Java, etc., color-coding for noce visuals, and more.
If you type "please help" or click the help button, it will replace the current project with a help screen that walks you through the basics of the language.
I will be releasing a video on how to use the IDE soon!



--- Things to Remember! ---
  DO NOT try to import a custom command you made unless you know what you're doing! There is a very specific syntax, and it will likely not work if you don't understand how to do it properly.
  Make sure to click on the macros and return to the main project when you load a project, as the macros will NOT compile until you click on and exit them!
  Do NOT change the save code when saving/loading a project unless you know what you're doing!
