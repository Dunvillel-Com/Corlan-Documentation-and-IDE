/this is a comment
/comments start with a slash


/its a good idea to start with these
clear mem
clear ui
/they clear the memory and screen


/these do math and logic
add
subtract
multiply
divide
check equal
/you have to have numbers in @1 and @2
/for these to work

/another useful function is domath()
/this runs the math function specified
/by the data given.
/here is the list in order of functions:
/sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
/ln, log, e**, 10**, abs


/to make math easier you can use these
add [1] to [2]
multiply [1] by [2]
/these use memory values
add (1) to [2]
multiply [1] by (10)
/these use a memory value and a number
/[] are for memory, alu and shift
/() are for number inputs

/to set items use setto
set [#1] to [@3]
set [#24] to (3.15)
/$ means shift and @ means alu
/and # means memory, but you dont have
/to put it, it just looks good

/some inputs are actual number inputs
/input sets shift to a number you set
input (1.24)
/and the first number in add to
add (4.02) to [1]
/you can only use 4 digits for numbers


/you can output memory values as shown
output [1]
output [23]
output [$]
output [@3]
/or you can output numbers like this
output (1)
output (23)
output (1.47)


/you can also draw values as shown
draw [1]
draw [204]
draw [$]
draw [@3]
/or you can draw number values
draw (1)
draw (12)
draw (413)
/it cant draw decimals though


/this is a wrapper
wrap next () lines
/it skips the next # of
/lines unless the shift ($)
/is equal to 1


/here is a full list of commands
input ()
add () to []
add [] to []
set [] to ()
set [] to []
multiply [] by ()
multiply [] by []
add
subtract
multiply
divide
do math ()
check equal
check greater
check less
mod
if or
if and
if xor
pause ()
output ()
output []
repeat last () for ()
jump to ()
clear ui
clear mem
draw ()
draw []

/you can use custom commands
/by typing import function,
/and there are some base functions
/you can import with the arrow button
/on the menu


/if a command is invalid it will
/look like this_example


/to finish a program, type end
/then hit enter to continue programming

/do not run this program on a computer
/it will cause problems

/come helpful commands you can also
/use are insert font, font type 2,
/clear all, and copy and paste program.
/these are only for use in the editor, they
/dont affect the program itself

/if your workspace is getting a bit cluttered,
/you can use macros, which store code
/that can be called using macro(#)
/there are only 6 macros at the moment
